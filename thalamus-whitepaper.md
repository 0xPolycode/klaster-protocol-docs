# Thalamus Protocol - A Cross-Chain Clustering Solution

## Introduction

Since the advent of smart contract blockchains in 2014 - the developers and the community have been working towards solving a few fundamental issues with the design of blockchain networks. One of those key problems is scalability - the blockchain design (as it exists today) must verify and store *all* transactions ever processed on it. This makes sense for large transactions between big accounts, but - if we're going to make blockchain the default financial backbone - there is no sense to employ the same security and finality to a person buying a cup of coffee and an insurance company paying out a multi-million insurance claim.

Currently, the most popular approach for solving this is to create multiple, independent blockchain networks (called many names - L2s, rollups, appchains, parachains, ...) which process transactions with differing speed, security and finality guarantees. This approach is employed by most major blockchain projects - from Ethereum with rollups, Polkadot with parachains, Avalanche with subnets, Cosmos with their "Internet of Blockchains", etc...

While there are still technical challenges in implementing these systems on a mainstream, commercial basis - the future of blockchain development is clear - many, independed AppChains & L2s, processing their own transactions and settling periodically on a few robust, battle-tested L1s.
